We created a remote control consist of 5 buttons (Left, right, forward, backward, stop). The visual studio code was used to write the program by using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP languages. In addition, we have used the CSS language to style the HTML document. The PhpMyAdmin was used to create the database. In the database, we have 1 row and 5 columns (left, right, forward, backward, stop) it is update when the user clicks on the buttons. We have connected the database to the control interface using buttons. like, when the user clicks the left button, we will send a “1” to the database which means that the left button is turned on. After clicking on the buttons that appear on the interface, then will open another PHP page that will show which button the user has pressed like, as if he/she pressed on the right button a PHP page will open containing “Right=1” on the left side. The purpose of this step is when the user pressed on the specific button, the position which the user has pressed on will appear on the PHP page, after that the robot will read it and then will run. Also, we create a responsive web by using the @media
